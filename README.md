### PhD Candidate in Human Medical Genetics and Genomics

#### Background
I am **Luciana Vargas, MSc**, a **_fifth-year predoctoral research associate_** in the [Human Medical Genetics and Genomics Program](https://www.cuanschutz.edu/graduate-programs/human-medical-genetics-and-genomics/home) at the [University of Colorado Anschutz, Department of Biomedical Informatics](https://medschool.cuanschutz.edu/dbmi/). 

I obtained my undergraduate degreee in Biomedical Sciences and Master's degree in Genetics from the [Federal University of Paran√° (UFPR)](https://internacional.ufpr.br/portal/about-ufpr/) in Curitiba, Brazil, as part of the [Human Molecular Genetics Laboratory (LGMH)](https://lgmh.ufpr.br). I also completed a study abroad focused in Medical Genetics at [Monash University](https://www.monash.edu/study/courses/find-a-course/biomedical-science-m2003), in Melbourne, Australia. 

#### Work
My day-to-day as a **_genetic epidemiologist_** involves using large health research consortia to enhance the utility of polygenic risk scores (PRS), social determinants of health (SDoH), and multi-omics (epigenomics, transcriptomics, proteomics & metabolomics) in characterizing and predicting pulmonary and cardiovascular diseases.
